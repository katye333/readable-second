# **The Readable Application**
---
---
The Readable Application allows users to create content in several predefined categories, comment on theirs and other users' posts as well as
vote on posts and comments. In addition, users will also be able to edit and delete both posts and comments.
This project is part of the ReactJS nanodegree offered by Udacity.

This application was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
